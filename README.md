# HCA Dev Conf 2016

## What do I do with this?

### Option 1: Follow along by stepping through the commit history with me as I give my lecture.

* Browse the commits in this repo by clicking on the commits tab up there
![Here's an image of the commmits tab, which lives up and to the left](commit-tab.jpg?raw=true)

* Jump to the sequencially labeled branches to see the major milestones of the
  project

### Option 2 (Hardcore):

* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Run `npm install -g mocha` at your command line (this command requires admin
  privilegeas)
* Clone this repo
* `cd` into the folder of this repo
* run `npm install` from within the folder of this repo
* run `mocha -w` from within the folder of this repo and watch the tests pass
* follow along with my as I break tests and fiddle with things
* fiddle with things yourself
